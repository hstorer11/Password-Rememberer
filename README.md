# Password Rememberer
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
I have created a website using HTML, CSS and Javascript. This website helps users keep track of their passwords because they are able to log their passwords to different websites they use by entering the name of the website and the password to match it. Once they have completed the input fields their passwords will be stored in a table and will also be kept in local storage so they do not lose their passwords when they have shut down the browser. This would come in handy is you have forgot your password because you will be able to find it in the table in the Password Rememberer.

The JSON file has been set up in order for me to store the inputs in local storage. I am storing the inputs in local storage because this ensures that any data the user has entered into the Password Remeberer in the past continues to be stored so that the user can access all of the passwords they have inputted into the website I have created. When users return to the Password Rememberer, all of the passwords they have ever inputted may not be visable on the table so the local storage set up is required because this is where all of the data about the passwords will be stored regardless of whether hisoric inputs have remained in the table or not.
