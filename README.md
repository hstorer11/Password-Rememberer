# Password Rememberer
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
I have created a website using HTML, CSS and Javascript. This website helps users keep track of their passwords because they are able to log their passwords to different websites they use by entering the name of the website and the password to match it. Once they have completed the input fields their passwords will be stored in a table and will also be kept in local storage so they do not lose their passwords when they have shut down the browser. This would come in handy is you have forgot your password because you will be able to find it in the table in the Password Rememberer.
